# Glossolalia

Glossolalia, often understood among Protestant Christians as speaking in tongues,
is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning,
in some cases as part of religious practice. Some consider it as a part of a sacred
language. It is a common practice amongst Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity.

You're welcome.
